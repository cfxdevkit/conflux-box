## üé¨ Video Structure & Script

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present Conflux Box for the Code Without Borders SummerHackfest 2025.

Conflux Box is a modern, beautiful frontend for Conflux blockchain development, built with Mantine UI and powered by the official Conflux DevKit packages.

The problem we're solving is that Conflux development lacked a modern, user-friendly interface that developers could use to easily interact with both Core Space and eSpace networks."
```

### 2. Solution Overview (60 seconds)

```
"Our solution is Conflux Box - a comprehensive development frontend that provides:

- A clean, modern interface built with Mantine UI
- Real-time blockchain monitoring and network status
- Account creation and management tools
- Smart contract deployment and interaction
- Seamless switching between Conflux Core and eSpace networks
- Integration with the official published DevKit packages

This makes Conflux development more accessible and enjoyable for developers of all skill levels."
```

   - Highlight real-time WebSocket updates
   - Demonstrate published package integration

```
Script for Demo Section:
"Let me show you Conflux Box in action.

First, here's our dashboard with a beautiful, modern interface. Notice the Network Information panel that dynamically shows the correct chain IDs based on the selected network - this was actually a bug we just fixed!

Watch as I switch between networks - you can see the chain IDs update automatically. For testnet, we see Core ID 1 and eVM ID 71, and for mainnet, Core ID 1029 and eVM ID 1030.

Moving to account management, you can easily create and manage development accounts. The interface is clean and provides all the information you need.

In the Contracts section, we have a powerful deployment wizard with pre-built templates. You can deploy contracts directly from the interface.

The Protocols section showcases real DeFi integration - here you can access GinsenSwap for DEX trading and Meson Bridge for cross-chain transfers. These integrations work on both testnet and mainnet, providing real utility to developers.

Everything is powered by the official Conflux DevKit packages, providing real-time updates through WebSocket integration."
```

### 4. Technical Implementation (60 seconds)

```
"Technically, Conflux Box is built with:

- React and TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- Mantine UI for beautiful, accessible components
- The official @conflux-devkit/node and @conflux-devkit/backend packages
- Real-time WebSocket integration for live updates
- Zustand and React Query for state management
- Comprehensive test suite with 14 passing tests

The key innovation is using the published DevKit packages, making this a reference implementation for how to build modern Conflux applications.

We overcame challenges in creating a seamless dual-chain experience and ensuring real-time synchronization with blockchain state."
```

### 5. Conclusion (30 seconds)

```
"Conflux Box represents the future of Conflux development - making blockchain development more accessible, modern, and enjoyable.

The project is open source and available on GitHub for the entire Conflux community to use and contribute to.

We believe this will help onboard more developers to the Conflux ecosystem by providing the tools they expect from modern development environments.

Thank you for watching, and we're excited to see what the community builds with Conflux Box!"
